# Project Euler Solutions

Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide. It includes over 600 problems, with a new one added once every two weeks. Problems are of varying difficulty but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer. As of May 2018 Project Euler has about 800,000 users, from all over the world, who have solved at least one problem.

This respository is  a solution pool among others, to the *Project Euler* problems. It's a set of computational solutions written in Python.
